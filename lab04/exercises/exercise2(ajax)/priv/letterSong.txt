ALL OF THE GIRLS YOU LOVED BEFORE
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me, "Baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is
All of the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street
Led you straight to me
Now you're all I need
I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now (ooh)
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (ooh)
We're breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (ooh)
And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you, "Baby"
It's why you're so amazing
All of the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street
Led you straight to me
Now you're all I need
I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels
Like the girls you loved before (ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (dead-end street)
Led you straight to me (straight to me)
Now you're all I need (all I need)
I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
